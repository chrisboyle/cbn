======================

This is the code behind my website, released under the MIT License. It's
nothing spectacular, it's my first Rails app, written because I wanted to learn
Rails, I wanted a new site/blog, and I believe the best way to learn a new
language/framework is to use it for a real-world project.

Features include OpenID/Facebook/Twitter login, a blog, comments (with
threading and moderation), a project list, static pages and some microformat
support.
